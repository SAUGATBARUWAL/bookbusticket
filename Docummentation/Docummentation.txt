Bus Ticket Booking System Documentation
The Bus Ticket Booking System is a Java-based application that uses Java Swing for the client-side GUI, Java Sockets for client-server communication, and JDBC for database interaction. The system is divided into three main components: the Client, the Server, and Shared classes.

1. Client
The client-side of the application is primarily handled by three classes: ClientGUI, ClientSock, and Main.

1.1 ClientGUI
The ClientGUI class extends JFrame and provides the graphical user interface for the client. It includes form fields for entering bus details (name, destination, date), book and refresh buttons, and a table for displaying data. The ClientGUI class also contains methods for handling button click events.

1.2 ClientSock
The ClientSock class handles the client-side socket connection and communication with the server. It sends data to the server when the book button is clicked in the GUI, and can receive data from the server.

1.3 Main
The Main class is the entry point for the client application. It creates an instance of ClientGUI and sets it visible.

2. Server
The server-side of the application is handled by four classes: Main, ServerSock, ClientHandler, and ServerData.

2.1 Main
The Main class is the entry point for the server application. It creates an instance of ServerSock.

2.2 ServerSock
The ServerSock class sets up the server socket and listens for incoming client connections. When a client connects, it creates a new ClientHandler to handle communication with that client.

2.3 ClientHandler
The ClientHandler class implements Runnable and is responsible for handling communication with a single client. It receives data from the client and broadcasts it to all connected clients.

2.4 ServerData
The ServerData class handles interaction with the database. It uses JDBC to connect to the database and execute SQL queries. It includes methods for saving a bus to the database and retrieving all buses from the database.

3. Shared
The shared package contains classes that are used by both the client and server.

3.1 Ticket
The Ticket class represents a bus ticket. It implements Serializable, allowing it to be sent over a socket connection. It includes fields for the name, destination, and date of a bus, as well as getter methods for these fields.
